libetonyek is a library and a set of tools for reading and converting
Apple Keynote presentations. The library tries to extract the most
important parts of version 2 format of Keynote (version 1 is not
supported yet, but it should be in the future. Version 6 is being
reverse engineered; we plan to support it as well when there is enough
info about the new format to implement something). See FEATURES for what
is currently supported.

Keynote documentation is, sadly, scarce. There are two official Apple
documents: The first one is "Technical Note 2073" (TN2073) [TODO: add
link], describing basic parts of the Keynote 1 format. The second is
"iWork Programming Guide", containing an overview of the Keynote 2
structure. Unfortunately it mostly documents things that do not need to
be documented: I mean, anyone can guess what elements like slide,
master-slide, stylesheet or layer mean, right? But how exactly does
style inheritance work? Which elements can be saved as a reference? What
do all these 1-3 letter elements and attributes in table model mean?
These and a lot of other questions remain unanswered. And that is just
the first incarnation of the version 2 format; nobody knows what has
changed since then.

Based on the previous paragraph, it should be clear that most of the
code in this library is based on guesses, sample presentations created
in Keynote '09 and "real-life" presentations collected on the Internet.

libetonyek requires boost, libwpd, libxml2 and zlib to build.

The library is available under MPL 2.0+.

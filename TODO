* The double indirection in storing object ID in pres. objects seems
  unnecessary. Why not store the real object? (Well, we would still need
  the dictionary for drawing, unless we resolved _all_ content
  recursively... Investigate.)

* Override default slide size by size from master slide or slide
  settings. (What to do if sizes of slide and its master do not match?
  If it can happen?)

* More TODO items are sprinkled over the source files...

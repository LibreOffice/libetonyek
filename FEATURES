= Format coverage =

== Currently supported ==

* shapes
  + simple shapes
    - rectangle
    - triangle
    - circle
    - generic path
  + text shapes
  + parametrizable shapes
    - polygon
    - star
    - arrow
    - double-sided arrow
  + transformations
* presentation text
  + formatting attributes
* media
  + images
  + movies and sounds
    - just insterted into the output. No fancy stuff like autoplay etc.
* tables
  + structure
  + text cells
  + number cells
    - but no numeric formats
* comments aka sticky notes
* (slide) notes

== Planned ==

* shape attributes (background / line)
* the rest of parametrizable shapes
* transitions
* animations
* auto-fitting of presentation text
* better handling of bullet lists
* connectors
* more cell types (date, duration)

== Unlikely to be supported ==

* charts
  + because there is a lot of stuff to do and it is an area I know very
    little about
  + it would be best to handle them through a separate API anyway
* formulas in tables

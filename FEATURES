= Format coverage =

== Currently supported ==

* shapes
  + simple shapes
    - rectangle, triangle, circle,...
  + text shapes
  + some parametrizable shapes
    - polygon, star, arrows
  + transformations
* presentation text
* media
  + images
  + movies and sounds
    -just insterted into the output. No fancy stuff like autoplay etc.

== Planned ==

* more formatting attributes
* tables
* comments aka sticky notes
* (slide) notes
* transitions
* animations
* auto-fitting of presentation text
* better handling of bullet lists
* connectors

== Unlikely to be supported ==

* charts
  + because there is a lot of stuff to do and it is an area I know very
    little about
  + it would be best to handle them through a separate API anyway
* formulas in tables

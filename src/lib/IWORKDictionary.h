/** A dictionary of all referenceable entities in the presentation.

  * In other words, all entities that might be included through a -ref
  * element in the format. This is purely a file format concept; all
  * that matters when an entity is inserted by a reference is that there
  * has been an entity of the same type and with the same content
  * inserted previously (or at least that is how I understand it. I
  * might be wrong about it). That means we need to know all entities in
  * the whole presentation to resolve references.
  *
  * @note The dictionary contains (among other things) all master
  * styles, therefore we do not handle them separately. (We might do
  * that in the future, to ensure correctness of the format.)
